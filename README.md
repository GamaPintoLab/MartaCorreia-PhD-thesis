## MartaCorreia-PhD-thesis
This repository contains annex files from the PhD thesis entitled as "Identification of novel biomarkers and candidate genes associated to lipid traits: improving the lipid metabolism knowledge base". The full description of each of these files can be found in the "Annex" section of this thesis. Briefly, annex 1 correspond to the PFHS-ped dataset, annex 2 has the full list of trained models, annex 5 correspond to the whole set of categorical variables associated to the PFHS-ped dataset for individuals of the "All" subset, and annex 6 gives the full classification prediction results for the "All" subset individuals following the application of the best trained model (Imp_B model). In addition, the annex 7 contains the complete list of target genes associated information collected for the development of a new lipid knowledge base, annex 8 and 9 correspond to the whole sets of selected GO terms including the GO hierarchical relations that define parent and child terms, for both lipid-specific and other GO terms lists, respectively.
